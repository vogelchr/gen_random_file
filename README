gen_random_file - Generate a file with random content.

For testing storage systems, I need a quick way to generate files
with random content in it. Linux' /dev/urandom is slow, so I wrote
this small wrapper around fastrand.h from Ivan Dimkovic
(included as fastrand.h).

NOTE: This program will most likely only work on a 64bit x86-64 PC
capable of using the SSE4 extensions.
